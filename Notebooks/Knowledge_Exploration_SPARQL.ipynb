    "The following questions are addressed using 16 targeted SPARQL queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What RDF classes are defined in the dataset?**  \n",
    "   → Query 1 lists all `rdf:type` instances used from the HTO namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What properties are used across the knowledge graph?**  \n",
    "   → Query 2 enumerates all `hto:` properties in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What Gazetteer series are present?**  \n",
    "   → Query 3 retrieves all `hto:Series` instances and their titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Who are the editors associated with volumes or series?**  \n",
    "   → Query 4 explores the `hto:editor` property, retrieves linked `hto:Person` entities, and their names via `foaf:name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What volumes are included, and how are they organized into series and collections?**  \n",
    "   → Query 5 lists all `hto:Volume` entities with their series and parent `hto:WorkCollection`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What metadata properties describe a given volume?**  \n",
    "   → Query 6 selects a sample volume and lists all associated RDF triples.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **How are `hto:OriginalDescription` entries structured?**  \n",
    "   → Query 7 lists all properties used to describe article-level entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What is the text and source of each article?**  \n",
    "   → Query 8 retrieves full text and source documents for descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What are all RDF triples for a specific article?**  \n",
    "   → Query 9 drills into a selected `hto:OriginalDescription` and inspects its metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **How is a `LocationRecord` structured?**  \n",
    "    → Query 10 retrieves a sample `hto:LocationRecord` and lists all associated properties including name, description, and pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What is the article title, text, and page range for each location record?**  \n",
    "    → Query 11 aggregates key fields (name, full text, start/end pages) from each `hto:LocationRecord`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **How has a specific place (e.g., \"DUNDEE\") been described across the corpus?**  \n",
    "    → Query 12 retrieves all articles titled \"DUNDEE\", including their text, source volume, parent series, and publication year.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What are the longest Gazetteer articles, and where do they appear?**  \n",
    "    → Query 13 lists the 10 longest `hto:LocationRecord` entries by text length, showing the article title, a text excerpt, the volume and series in which the article was published, and the year of publication. This helps surface dense or historically significant entries for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Which Gazetteer articles refer to other entries, and what do they reference?**  \n",
    "    → Query 14 explores internal semantic links using the `hto:refersTo` property. It returns `hto:LocationRecord` entries that refer to other records, displaying both the source and target names. This enables tracing redirects, summaries, and cross-references within the Gazetteers knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Which article titles are reused across multiple Gazetteer entries?**  \n",
    "    → Query 15 groups `hto:LocationRecord` entries by their `hto:name` and lists those names that appear in multiple records. These cases reveal reused or ambiguous place names across volumes or editions (e.g., “LOGIE”, “KIRKHILL”), useful for disambiguation or tracking editorial duplication over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Which Gazetteer articles include alternate or variant names?**  \n",
    "    → Query 16 identifies articles that contain both a primary name (`hto:name`) and one or more alternate names (`rdfs:label`), typically derived from metadata fields such as “Alternative names.” This supports fuzzy search, historical variant matching, and linguistic normalization.\n",

      " a royal borough in the county of Angus or Forfar, seated on the N. bank of the river Tay, about 12 miles from its mouth, in 5627' 23'' N. latitude, and 32' W. longitude from Greenwich. It is a large and well built town, consisting of several streets, diverging in every direction from the market-place or high-street, which is a fpac'ious square 360 feet long by 100 feet broad. On the S. side of this square stands the Town-hoitfe, an elegant ftruclure, with a handfomc front, adorned with piazzas below, and overtopped by a neat spire 140 feet in height: this building, which was finished in 1734, contains the guild hall, the court room, townclerk's office, with vaulted repofitories for the town records, and apartments for the Dundee Banking Company's office : the prison occupies the upper story, and does much honour to the feelings of the magistrates,underwhofe auspices it was erected, the rooms being well aired and commodious, and at the same time perfectly secure. At the E. end of the square, the incorporated trades have erected an elegant Trades' hall, with a superb front of Ionic pilasters, and a neat cupola the lower flat is occupied by shops, and the upper flat contains rooms for each incorporation, and a large hall for general meetings, which is now occupied as a fubfeription coffee-room, on the most liberal and extensive plan. Opposite to the Trades' hall, in the W. end of the square, a neat Episcopal chapel has been lately built. At the S. E. corner of the square, about 100 feet from the Trades' hall, stood the castle-hill, so called from the ancient castle. It was composed entirely of a hard bafaltic whinftone, and has lately been quarried away at a great expence, and a fine spacious street, called Cajlle Jlreet, has been opened to the harbour. A small distance W. from the great square, is the old church, in which wereoriginally 4 places of worship, and when entire had been a very magnificent building, with a large square Gothic tower or steeple 156 feet high, at the W. end of the church ; it is said to have been erected by David F;arl of Huntingdon, in 1189, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary, in gratitude for his deliverance from shipwreck, in which he had nearly perished withal this cattle Bothwell fled and left Mary, after the unfortunate battle of Carberry till. The castle was afterwards demoliihed by order of the Scottiih parliament. In this parish is part of Down hill, famous for the encampment of General Leflie and the Scottiih army, the night before their defeat at the battle of D unbar. There is plenty of limeftone in the parish. On shore pebbles are frequently found, and near the harbour is a fine specimen of martial jasper, which takes a Very fine poliih. Here are frequently found those beautiful specimens of ge'ddes orfeptaria, iron ore, generally termed the geodes of Dunbar. Population returned to Sir John Sinclair, .-5700.\n",
