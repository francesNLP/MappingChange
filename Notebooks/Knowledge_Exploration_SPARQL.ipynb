    "The following questions are addressed using 16 targeted SPARQL queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What RDF classes are defined in the dataset?**  \n",
    "   → Query 1 lists all `rdf:type` instances used from the HTO namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What properties are used across the knowledge graph?**  \n",
    "   → Query 2 enumerates all `hto:` properties in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What Gazetteer series are present?**  \n",
    "   → Query 3 retrieves all `hto:Series` instances and their titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Who are the editors associated with volumes or series?**  \n",
    "   → Query 4 explores the `hto:editor` property, retrieves linked `hto:Person` entities, and their names via `foaf:name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What volumes are included, and how are they organized into series and collections?**  \n",
    "   → Query 5 lists all `hto:Volume` entities with their series and parent `hto:WorkCollection`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What metadata properties describe a given volume?**  \n",
    "   → Query 6 selects a sample volume and lists all associated RDF triples.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **How are `hto:OriginalDescription` entries structured?**  \n",
    "   → Query 7 lists all properties used to describe article-level entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What is the text and source of each article?**  \n",
    "   → Query 8 retrieves full text and source documents for descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What are all RDF triples for a specific article?**  \n",
    "   → Query 9 drills into a selected `hto:OriginalDescription` and inspects its metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **How is a `LocationRecord` structured?**  \n",
    "    → Query 10 retrieves a sample `hto:LocationRecord` and lists all associated properties including name, description, and pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What is the article title, text, and page range for each location record?**  \n",
    "    → Query 11 aggregates key fields (name, full text, start/end pages) from each `hto:LocationRecord`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **How has a specific place (e.g., \"DUNDEE\") been described across the corpus?**  \n",
    "    → Query 12 retrieves all articles titled \"DUNDEE\", including their text, source volume, parent series, and publication year.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What are the longest Gazetteer articles, and where do they appear?**  \n",
    "    → Query 13 lists the 10 longest `hto:LocationRecord` entries by text length, showing the article title, a text excerpt, the volume and series in which the article was published, and the year of publication. This helps surface dense or historically significant entries for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Which Gazetteer articles refer to other entries, and what do they reference?**  \n",
    "    → Query 14 explores internal semantic links using the `hto:refersTo` property. It returns `hto:LocationRecord` entries that refer to other records, displaying both the source and target names. This enables tracing redirects, summaries, and cross-references within the Gazetteers knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Which article titles are reused across multiple Gazetteer entries?**  \n",
    "    → Query 15 groups `hto:LocationRecord` entries by their `hto:name` and lists those names that appear in multiple records. These cases reveal reused or ambiguous place names across volumes or editions (e.g., “LOGIE”, “KIRKHILL”), useful for disambiguation or tracking editorial duplication over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Which Gazetteer articles include alternate or variant names?**  \n",
    "    → Query 16 identifies articles that contain both a primary name (`hto:name`) and one or more alternate names (`rdfs:label`), typically derived from metadata fields such as “Alternative names.” This supports fuzzy search, historical variant matching, and linguistic normalization.\n",
