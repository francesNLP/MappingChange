    "# Knowledge Exploration With SPARQL queries\n",
    "This notebook explores the knowledge in knowledge graphs generated in this repository using sparql queries. Note that, this notebook are **only designed to test or explore sample knowledge graphs** as loading large graph here can be time-consuming!\n",
    "Overall, we will parse an RDF source to a Graph using rdflib, and explore the knowledge by querying the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions this knowledge graph should answer:\n",
    "1. List all the volumes in the Gazetteers collection\n",
    "2. Where was an edition _E_, published or printed?\n",
    "3. What articles are included in a volume _V_?\n",
    "4. What is the text content of an article _A_?\n",
    "5. What are the references articles of an article _A_?\n",
    "6. What sources the text descriptions of article _A_ are extracted from?\n",
    "7. Given an article about a place, how this place has been described across years.\n"
